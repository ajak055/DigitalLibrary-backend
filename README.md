**-- Build & Deployment ---**
To build the image use mvn package

you can run this application in 3 ways
1. Using jar
2. By building docker image
3. Using Kubernetes deployment

Once jar is build you can use Dockerfile present in root folder to build an image
cmd : docker build -t <name>/<imagename:version>
it build image with your dockerId 

Once image is build you can run by providing
docker run -p 8081:8080 -d name/imagename:version

To deploy as kubernetes application
Use KubernetesFiles folder, in deployment yaml add you image location (docker hub) and provide below command

kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f libraray_service.yaml (this is to expose application through service)

once both are deployed you can check by giving kubectl get pods
if pods are in running state, then 
try localhost:80/v1/asset (get request)
